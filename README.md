#Dr.Dot

Dr. Dot is an open-source suite of tools and commands on the Amazon Echo to allow people to get matched to the medical services they need as soon as possible. Through different commands to Amazon Alexa, we wish to be able to help people of all ages and occupations, whether it be children, adults, or the elderly, find and contact the correct medical services for their specific situations.

Some features in place currently are:
  * Contacts caregivers and emergency contacts in times of emergency through text using Twilio's API Service
  * Gives you information on a doctor in the area who can take care of the specific illness symptopms you are experiencing

## USAGE
  * Prompt Alexa: "Alexa - send help using dr.dot"
           Alexa: "Help is on the way. You can cancel help with: 'cancel help using dr. dot.'"
  * Prompt Alexa: "Alexa - symptoms with dr.dot"
           Alexa: "Please state your primary symptoms."

## [INTERFACES] _(if applicable)_ 
We currently use Amazon Alexa through Amazon's Echo Dot as our main interface to query APIs with symptoms or ask for medical assistance.
In addition, we also use a small web app that gets data from our BetterDoctor queries in order to display the information of the nearest relevant doctor.
